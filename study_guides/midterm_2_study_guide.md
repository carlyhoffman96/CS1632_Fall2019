# CS 1632 Midterm 2 Exam Study Guide - Fall 2019

Midterm 2 is on Dec 4 (Wed), 2019.

The midterm will cover everything we have covered since Midterm 1, starting
from Automated System Testing.  I recommend you review the slides and the
textbook (See syllabus.md for which chapters are required reading.  The reading
is also on the last slide of each lecture).  You are also expected to have
completed Exercises 3, 4 and 5, and be able to answer related questions.

The exam will consist of these types of questions:
  * Multiple choice questions
  * Fill in the blank questions
  * Short answer questions (explain a concept, discuss pros/cons, etc.)
  * Code tracing questions

Here are the key topics to study in preparation for the test.

_Note: the items in italic are learning goals that require application of your
knowledge.  Either you have to apply your knowledge to a piece of code, or you
need to apply an algorithm to a specific problem._

## AUTOMATED (WEB) SYSTEMS TESTING
* Be able to explain why testing a GUI web application involves a lot of text
  testing, just like text UI applications.
* Be able to discuss reasons why testing an HTML verbatim against an expected
  HTML page is not desirable.
* Be able to explain why in Katalon / Selenium, there is an option to select
  different locator strings for the same target element.

## PERFORMANCE TESTING
* Be able to compare different definitions of speed: throughput,
  responsiveness, and utilization
* Be able to apply appropriate definition of speed according to context (type
  of application).
* Be able to define performance indicator, KPIs, performance targets,
  performance thresholds.
* Be able to explain different categories and subcategories of performance
  indicators: service-oriented indicators / efficiency-oriented indications.
Also, be able to explain the reasoning behind the categorization.
* Be able to discuss reasons why statistical reasoning is mandatory when
  measuring response time.  Be able to list examples of factors that can cause
variability when measuring response time.
* Be able to define real time (wall clock time), user time, system time, and
  total time accurately.  Be able to explain why certain types of time may be
important when measuring certain performance indicators.
* Be able to explain what the "nines" notation means for availability.
* Be able to explain why availability is hard to measure directly.
* Be able to explain how baseline, soak (stability), and stress load testing
  can help model availability.
* Be able to explain what value efficiency-oriented indicators provide beyond
  service-oriented indicators, which already measure user experience.
* Be able to differentiate between general purpose and program-specific
  utilization measurement tools.
* Be able to explain why low-utilization does not always mean high-throughput.

## STOCHASTIC / PROPERTY-BASED TESTING
* Be able to define accurately what stochastic testing is.
* Be able to define accurately what property-based testing is.
* Be able to explain why property-based testing is necessary for stochastic
  testing.
* Be able to define what an invariant is.
* Be able to discuss the advantages / disadvantages of property-based testing.
* Be able to explain why "shrinking" in quickcheck is useful for debugging.
* Be able to define what fuzz testing is.
* Be able to explain why complete random input generation when fuzz testing is
  ineffective, using an example.
* _Be able to come up with invariants of your own given a piece of (pseudo)
  code._

## PAIRWISE / COMBINATORIAL TESTING
* Be able to interpret the results of the NIST study on the frequency of
  defects for various numbers of variable interactions.
* Be able to define what pairwise testing is and what combinatorial testing is.
* Be able to define what a covering array is.
* _Be able to create a covering array for the given list of parameters and the
  given number of interactions (t)._

## STATIC TESTING PART 1
* Be able to discuss the pros / cons of static testing compared to dynamic
  testing.
* Be able to discuss why choice of language is important for static testing, in
  terms of compiling and other static tests.
* Be able to explain the differences between different types of code coverage.
* Be able to explain why 100% code coverage necessarily does not mean defect
  free.
* Be able explain similarities between linters and bug finders (pattern
  matching) and the differences (usage).

## STATIC TESTING PART 2
* Be able to define what formal verification is.
* Be able to explain how theorem proving seeks to achieve formal verification.
* Be able to explain how model checking seeks to achieve formal verification.
* Be able to discuss pros / cons of theorem proving compared to model checking.
* Be able to compared the similarities and differences of model checking
  compared to property-based testing.
* Be able to explain how backtracking and state matching both help in make
  state space exploration efficient for model checkers.
* Be able to explain what the state explosion problem is.
* Be able to explain how abstact model checking is different from concrete
  model checking.
* Be able to explain why abstract model checking is attractive (because it
  reduces the state explosion problem) and where it is deficient (it cannot
model complex programs with pointers, dynamic object creation, etc.)
* Be able to explain each state space reduction technique: state collapsing,
  state approximation, hash compaction, heap canonicalization.
* Be able to tell which of the above techniques are unsound and why.
* _Given code, be able identify parts of it that leads to state space explosion._
* _Given a state transition diagram, be able to draw backtracking arrows._

## STATIC TESTING PART 3
* Be able to explain how symbolic execution can drastically reduce the size of
  the state space.
* Be able to explain what role a constraint solver plays in symbolic execution.
* Be able to explain how concolic testing, or directed automated random
  testing, helps overcome the deficiencies of symbolic execution.
* _Given code, be able to trace through the code, creating a symbolic
execution tree in the process.  Each statement in the tree should have an
associated path condition.  Also, if the statement is an assignment, a symbolic
expression should be assigned to the variable instread of a concrete value._


## SECURITY TESTING
* Be able to list the Infosec (CIA) triad
* Be able to tell which of the triad a particular category of attacks
  (interruption, interception, modification, fabrication) tries to compromise.
* Be familiar with the terminology of vulnerability and exploit.
* Be able to tell the differences between the numerous types of malicious code
  and be familiar with the terminology.
* Be able to explain how each of the 8 common types of attacks are perpetrated
  and possible protections.
* Be able to explain what Single Origin Policy is in web security.
